                <p>I have loved Relient K since I was a pre-teen. I have seen them live many times. They were my first live concert I attended in St. Pete, FL. I like that their lyrics have a lot of depth and substance, but that they have a humorous quality, as well. I like the personalities of the two main band members. I would love for them to release more music. They recently announced that they are going back on tour after a long hiatus, which makes me hopeful that they make release new music soon. Their long career is truly admirable. Not very many bands can last 20+ years and still maintain a dedicated fan base like they have.</p>
